            <h2>Soil and water conservation</h2>
            <p>Soil Conservation is one of the basic programmes required to be undertaken for sustained agricultural production. It brings about permanent improvement in the land resources and helps in preserving moisture in the soil for a long period. About 80 to 85 Percent of the State's agricultural production comes from rainfed areas. Since the irrigation potential in the State is limited to only 30 Percent of the total cultivated area, the development of scientific rainfed agriculture is of paramount importance. Moreover, of the total irrigation potential, only 40 Percent to 50 Percent is on account of surface irrigation and the remaining is accounted for by exploitation of underground water resources. These, in turn can be enhanced by proper watershed management methods which reduce surface run-off and improves infiltration and recharge capacities.</p>
            <h3>Animal Husbandary</h3>
            <p>Animal Husbandry schemes are particularly important from the point of view of tribal population. This programme not only provides a subsidiary source of income to the tribal population, but it also takes care of the requirement of nutritious food for them. Livestock resources are abundant in tribal areas, which will be evident from the fact that about 27 percent and 19 percent respectively of the total cattle and buffalo stock in the State are in the tribal areas. The number of sheep and goat in the tribal areas is also sizable, being 11 percent and 22 percent of the total sheep and goat population respectively. Nearly, 25 percent of the poultry stock is also in the tribal areas. However, the livestock and poultry in tribal areas are stunted in growth and less productive in terms of milk, eggs and meat. The objective of the Animal Husbandry Programme in the Tribal areas is therefore, to achieve accelerated growth in the production of all livestock products by providing them breeding and health cover facilities also basic infrastructure facilities.</p>
