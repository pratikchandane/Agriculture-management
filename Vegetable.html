    <p>Sustaining and expanding Horticultural Revolution
        Introduction
        Maharashtra is one of the leading states in the country in Horticulture
        Development. The diverse agro-climatic conditions of the state are very
        congenial for cultivation of various horticultural crops. The area under fruit crops
        which was 2.42 lakh ha. in 1990 has gone up to 12.89 lakh ha. in 2002. Similarly,
        the area under various vegetables, spice crops and floriculture has also
        increased substantially. This is mainly due to the Govt. policies like
        establishment of separate Department of Horticulture in 1981 and linking
        horticulture development with Employment Guarantee Scheme in 1990. Creation
        of various infrastructure facilities like establishment of horticulture nurseries,
        irrigation facilities also helped for horticulture development.
        With the expansion of area under horticulture, production of fruits has increased
        substantially. However the marketing of fruits could not be organized
        simultaneously. At present markets are dominated by middlemen and they decide
        the prices of fruits. Unless the farmers form cooperative and open their sale
        outlets in urban areas, the exploitation from middlemen would not be reduced.
        The farmers in some areas have organized themselves and formed fruit
        producers cooperatives.
        The merchants do not have knowledge of handling of produce. Transportation is
        more oriented towards quantitative basis rather than qualitative basis. Timely
        availability of the transport is a matter of concern. e.g. Jalgaon district is well
        known for banana cultivation. Wagon loads of bananas are transported to North
        India every day from Jalgaon. However, since the railway wagons are not
        specially designed for transport of fruits, great losses are incurred during April to
        June which are months of severe heat.
        Due to lack of cold chain, considerable losses are incurred in fruits and
        vegetables. Cold chains have been established in some limited areas of grapes.
        This has helped to increase shelf life, storage, transport and export of grapes.
        Due to lack of processing facilities, great losses occur in fruits and vegetables. It
        is therefore necessary to give thrust on processing of fruits and vegetables both

        both in domestic and export markets. The exports of processed products of fruits
        and vegetables have increased which shows that there is increasing demand for
        these products. </p>
